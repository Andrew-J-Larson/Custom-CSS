# User-Styles
Useful injected styles for certain websites (best used with an extention such as Stylus).

For any folder, it starts off with the website a style can be used with, and inside of each folder will be either user styles or more folders that pertain to specific areas on the website.

For a style that works on all websites (or filters itself based on mulitple websites), they'll most likely reside in the "Any" folder.
